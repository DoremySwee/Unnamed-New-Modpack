The modpack has several difficulties:
    Easy, Normal, Hard, Lunatic, Ultra.
When you enter the survival world, after your confirmation, the world is binded onto the current difficulty.
The current difficulty is in scripts/Config.zs. (static DIFF as int) Rewrite the variable to change the difficulty. You need to save the file, and restart the game.

The survival world is always binded to the selected difficulty. When it's found that the current difficulty is not the world difficulty, there will be error messages.
    Usually, you are suggested to fix the [current difficulty], and restart the game.
        Unfortunately, your automations might have run into problems as you entered the world with wrong difficulty, since the recipes don't match.
    If you persist to play in the new difficulty, type "/syncDifficulty".
        This doesn't change the quest difficulty. If you want to change the quest difficulty, enable FTBQuest Editing mode.
        It's not suggested to change the world difficulty, since many recipes will have changed.

On the other hand, non-survival world don't have this problem.
You can type "/setTestWorld true" to change the world into a non-survival world.
